# Learning new programming language
Hello, I've been thinking about learning new language to see the software world with a different eye except C# and finally I can do it while I am free of working. I thing learning new programming language is somthing like learning new speacking language. You can know more culcher, comunicate with more pepole, learn new things and ...

# Why GoLang?
At the first I started with python. I did some little stuff with it but to be honest I didn't like it to continue, perhaps for the differences between Python and C# that made it hard to me to migrate. Python was a good language but I was adictted to C# :)
I knew a little bit about GoLang, just I knew it used by Google. Afew days beafor I created this repository i was in a situation to have a look on this language and check the possibelity to migrate to it so I read many article and checked its documentation and after 2 hours I write a Hello World with it and realy i found it lovely language to learn. It is like C and have a diffrent vission in developing. For many years I've just been swimming in C# and OOP, they were the world for me and I didnt like it.
GoLang is much more easier than Python to migrate from C# and it has some good feature that can help you either in the market and improving your software knowledge

# Start lerning!
I've just like to make it easy to myself, I've been in love with C# my whole life so it is my main solution for real life of programing. But I'm so passionate to develope some real-world applications with GoLang soon.

I start learning with 2 main resources to learn basic things and after that I will try advance topics by new resources.
